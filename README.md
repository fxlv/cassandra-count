# cassandra-count
Count rows in Cassandra Table

Simple program to count the number of records in a Cassandra table.
By splitting the token range using the numSplits parameter, you can
reduce the amount each query is counting and reduce the probability
of timeouts.

It is true the Spark is well-suited to this operation, however the
goal of this program is to be a simple utility that does not require
Spark.  This is useful for simple debugging of loading data (and other
data quality tasks).  Spark provides much (MUCH) more than this utility
is addressing - I highly recommend Spark+Cassandra.

## Getting it

### Downloading
This utility has already been built, and is available at
https://github.com/brianmhess/cassandra-count/releases/download/v0.0.6/cassandra-count

Get it with wget:
```
wget https://github.com/brianmhess/cassandra-count/releases/download/v0.0.6/cassandra-count
```

You can change the permissions on that file to executable and execute it
directly.  It is also a proper jar file so you can also run via
```
java -jar cassandra-count
```
And add whatever extra arguments you want.  For example:
```
java -jar cassandra-count -Xmx1G
```

### Building
To build this repository, simply clone this repo and run:
```
gradle buildit
```

All of the dependencies are included (namely, the Java driver - currently
version 3.0.0).  The output will be the cassandra-loader executable
in the build directory.  There will also be an jar with all of the
dependencies included in the build/libs/cassandra-count-uber-<version>.jar

## Documentation 
To extract this README document, simply run (on the cassandra-count
executable - (e.g., on build/cassandra-count):
```
jar xf cassandra-count README.md
```
